# Truffle-MetaCoin

### Overview

In this project I wanted to review how a smart contract is compiled and deployed using the Truffle framework. Truffle is a testing framework for smart contracts that makes things easier for the developer. The suite is packed with many features and tools such as ganche (local blockchain) and drizzle which is a front end framework for dApp design. I took time to look into Truffle box called "MetaCoin" to see how a token is created at a basic level. Truffle boxes are templates of code that allow you to learn how the framework works.

### Dependencies

* Nodejs
* Npm 
* Truffle Framework install

### Executing program

* execute contract in Remix IDE or Terminal of code IDE of choice.
